        <h2><kbd>Welcome to Black Mountain Elementary School</kbd>
        </h2>

        <p>Black Mountain is an exciting learning community where we empower our students to be their best using their head, heart and hands. Our students are safe, connected, and valued in our school where we expect them to think, to have empathy, and to contribute. Surveys have stated the best things about Black Mountain are the friendly people, and the great environment. On one feedback form a student wrote, "The best thing about BME is the caring, loving teachers and students." And, one other student wrote, "The best thing about BME is everyone is happy, joyful, and kind to each other."
            It's true - each day at BME we celebrate active citizenship, and encourage our students to respect not only themselves, but others. Older students at Black Mountain take pride in their school community and are seen as leaders by the younger students. Students respect and look out for one another, regardless of age, and even take the time to know each other's names. One can often see appropriate behaviours being modeled and taught by older students to younger ones - during Buddy Time, Shared Reading time, Peer Mentoring time, and playground time to name a few.
            We are fortunate to have a caring, committed, and knowledgeable staff that collaborate together, and build important relationships to consider all aspect of the child. Our staff provide an inclusive and differentiated learning community. Overall the staff is valued in the community as caring individuals who work hard and are committed to building positive relationships. Our staff consists of 20 classroom teachers, who are supported by a principal, a vice principal, a learning assistant teacher, a teacher-librarian, a counselor, a resource teacher, a Fine Arts teacher, an indigenous advocate, and several certified educational assistants, servicing approximately 450 students</p>

        <h2><kbd>principals message</kbd></h2>
        <p>The staff of Black Mountain Elementary would like to welcome you to our school for the 2020-2021 school year. As a school community, we are honoured to serve your children in the vital task of formal public education. We recognize the active involvement of parents and guardians as invaluable as we all attempt to deliver the best possible program for each child. We trust that students and parents will enjoy the time spent in our school and hope there will be an active involvement in the many and varied programs which are made available to enhance all educational experiences.



            Black Mountain keeps getting better with age! We have a great team of dedicated staff, complemented by extremely supportive parents. Put those two attributes together with just about 430 eager, curious and hardworking students and you have a recipe for success â€“ both academically and socially. Once again I look to our school year with much anticipation and expect that as a school we can deliver quality education, while at the same time, help to build strong memories of a positive, productive elementary school experience.
